## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I tried to focus on a mobile-firt workflow as it's something I haven't done before! I found it to be a lot faster to set up the inital styling, as I was able to get the basics out of the way first.

I did struggle a little bit with utilisng CSS Grid, as it has been a while and I have only very limited experience with it, so this was good to get some more practice in. Using Grid and Flexbox together was also something new for me, as I haven't worked with many multiple element designs. It was difficult knowing there was an easier way when I was staring down the road of individually setting each element's grid-area manually.

Another issue I had was with the SVG, I'm not sure whether it was my lack of understanding with using SVG's or if it was the link provided, but I was unable to change the size of it. In the end, I found another free shopping cart SVG to use, as the scale of it on the desktop wasn't working.

### Continued development

I am familiar with responsive design, but I would like to continue working with Grid a little more often so it easier when it comes up next. Also working with mobile first design is something I will play around with in the future to see if it suits my workflow better.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/css-flexbox-poster.png) - This poster by CSS-Tricks is good to keep on hand for reference when using Flex.
- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/css-grid-poster.png) - This poster by CSS-Tricks is something I always come back to when playing around with Flex, and finding one for Grid was exceptionally helpful.
